# Caleb Draes

## Youth

Growing up with his Elven father and Human mother, Caleb had trouble fitting in.
Living with his father's family, Caleb and his mother were not accepted by the family.
His paternal family never liked his father marrying a human and treated them like outsiders.

As a boy he was always seeking his father's attention, but his father was to busy with his work.
When playing with other kids he'd usually be the one to decide what should be done.
And he always got the other kids to do all the work for him, because he would always feel like it wouldn't be good enough anyway.

## Teenager

The marriage between his parents was strained and turned from bad to worse.
Caleb was never good enough for his father, always complaining why he couldn't just keep up with the rest (elves).
Causing Caleb to avoid his father whenever possible, mostly by going on adventures with his friends.

## Schooling

Fed up with his son just fooling about with non-elves, he send Caleb to study with a scholar.
Trying to please his father and rebel at the same time, Caleb always made sure the required work was done.
But never anything more than absolutely required.
As time went on, suspicion arose that he was cheating, as he was seeing reading books unrelated to his work at hand.

## Adolescent

When his mother fell ill, Caleb took his mother to her parents to recover in a more friendly setting.
Caleb's father did not agree and finally saw a good reason for a divorce.
His father remarried, an elven woman, and had several more children.
Caleb felt betrayed and rejected at the same time and couldn't help but feel he wasn't good enough.

## Adult

His mother never recovered and in the last few years Caleb took great care for her.
He managed to get favors from many towns folk for helping a hand.
Liked especially by those neither human or elven.
He always seemed to be in the company of strangers and those who didn't seem to fit in.

## Work

Caleb worked as a scribe while taking care of his mother.
Mostly copying books and keeping records for the local government.
Highly regarded as someone who can get things done, though hardly seen to do the work himself.

## Warlock

While taking care of the many books at the local government buildings, he always read the ones without titles.
Trying to find those stories that, like himself, didn't really seem to fit.
He kept a stash of books he found interesting, books that felt unnatural.

A while after his mother died, Caleb decided he needed to get away from his maternal family.
They didn't take kindly to him and blamed him for his mother's early death.
As he was seen as the reason for friction between her and her ex-husband.

Fearing his father would not take kindly to him not having achieved much.
Caleb desperately tried to find ways in the books he had stashed to cheat his way into achievements, abilities, power and the like.
Eventually he found one book that was particularly cryptic, but having a eery feeling with it.
Curious as he was, Caleb spend weeks trying to figure out what it really meant. 

Finding out it was a speaking about rituals for a pact, although unclear about the cost it claimed rewards.
Rewards of great power, access to other realms magics and powers.
Even powers to manipulate people's minds!

Seeing as Caleb was already very comfortable manipulating people in doing his bidding, this seemed like  a dream come true.
He followed the instructions for as much as he could understand.
At first nothing happened, but then he could hear a faint whisper.
The whisper became louder, and chilled him to his core.
The voice whispered several  seemingly unrelated statements:

- "Your friends will abandon you... "
- "You are weak, but I can make you strong"
- "Do my bidding, or your heart will explode!"

Caleb could feel himself filled with a power, and seemed to be able to whisper without making a sound...
That night he dreamt of strange worlds, making no sense to him at all.
The next day he tried his silent whisper on a fellow scribe... the result was horror on the face of the man and he ran out of the building.

Caleb felt he could impress his father, but probably required further experimentation.
Over the next months he delved further into the book and understood more and more.
He felt ready for testing his power in the world, to leave his carefully crafted easy life behind and take on the world.
And it would not be first nor the last time Caleb went from reluctance to act to feverish for action.

## Waterdeep

Caleb moved to Waterdeep following his decision to leave his maternal city.
Working as a scribe for local govenment services, mostly busy with the upcoming city census.
