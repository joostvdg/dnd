# Warlock Usefull Info

## Pact of the Tome

> Your patron give you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

> If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

## Ancient Secrets

Ik heb de players handbook gelezen en wat extra resources (see below).
Van wat ik begrijp, is het een eldritch invocation die ik kan leren.
Op level 3 heb ik hier twee slots van, maar die heb ik al gebruikt.
Op level 5 krijg ik een derde slot en kan ik dus dat "boek" kiezen.
De spells komen terecht in mijn "Book of Shadows", wat het boek is van de "Pact of the Tome".

Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature

> You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any classâ€™s spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
> On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
